Click the screen and watch as the hand taps the closest domino, causing it to fall over and topple the rest in an exciting domino effect!

Wow, a cash prize? That's not suspicious at all! There's no way this will be a scamâ€”

Oh. Never mind, then.

For this project, I wanted to incorporate images into my sketch and practice tranformations. I was originally hoping to make the dominos spin a few degrees before stopping once they fell over, but I couldn't figure out a good way to make them stop spinning, so I instead just made them rotate once to a fallen over position. I'm not entirely happy with the results of this project, but it was good practice and showed me what to improve on in the future, which I'm always glad for!
